# TinyApp

A Full-Stack web app, similar in function to [TinyURL](https://tinyurl.com)

TinyApp is an application utilizing Node and ExpressJS, and a touch of Bootstrap CSS. <br>
Its purpose is to allow registered users to create short URLS to share on the internet or among friends. Rather than sharing links with 100+ characters in them, we store your `longURLS` and we redirect visitors to it through our `shortURLs` which you can share.

Gone are the days of links taking up half of your character limit on social media! <br>
Thanks TinyApp you're the best.
